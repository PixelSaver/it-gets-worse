# It Gets WORSE

It Gets *WORSE* is a fast-paced 2D survival shooter inspired by 20 Minutes Till Dawn and Vampire Survivors. The twist: you start with random upgrades, but as time passes the game steadily hands you debuffs. Enemies keep coming, the challenge ramps up, and survival becomes harder with every second.

## Features
Survival gameplay – Fight waves of enemies that grow in number and strength.
Randomized starts – Begin each run with a different set of upgrades for replayability.
Debuff system – The longer you last, the more you level up, and the more the game works against you.
Simple but relentless loop – Easy to pick up, difficult to survive. 

## How to Play
Web version on [my itch](https://pixelsaver.itch.io/it-gets-worse) (or build it with godot)
Move to dodge incoming enemies. (WASD)
Shoot to survive as long as possible. (Left Click, aim with mouse position)
Adapt to your random upgrades and overcome the debuffs stacking against you.

## Inspiration
This project draws inspiration from 20 Minutes Till Dawn and Vampire Survivors, reimagined with its own escalating difficulty mechanic.

## How It's Made
Tech used: Godot Engine, GD Script

## Lessons Learned
Spent 2 days learning the UI in Godot, and I'm looking forward to working with it again. I saw some really cool exmaples and might be making something along the lines of those later on. It was quite the adventure to learn tool scripts to load all the upgrade resources, and also my first time coding with an artist. Pretty cool! Does make me appreciate all the oomph that developers put into such simple games like 20 Minutes. Cheers to good game dev!!

Art from my good friend @OfKnee (not sure how to @ a github account from a readme but there you go)

## Afterthoughts
This was quite the journey... I spent two whole days on user interface. I'm most proud of the upgrade system even though it's still a bit jank.
Note to future self (or anyone who wants to enter my undocumented non-commented spaghetti code), what I wanted to do but didn't have time for:
* Have a lot more upgrades (combo, critical, etc, find some ideas in the res://Upgrades/Unfinished/)
* Add maybe 3 different random builds to choose from at the start to make the game a lot less rng and a lot more skill
* Balance enemy spawning, exp, upgrades, add synergies between them, etc
* MORE ART, a lot of the upgrades now don't have the godot icon.svg as the image...
* Saves, high scores, and meta upgrades that last between rounds would make it a lot more engaging for longer
* POLISH, the ui is still kinda jank, the sprites aren't very animated, the color pallette is all over the place (no hate OfKnee)
* More enemy types
* Multiplayer??? (very hard but doable I think)
